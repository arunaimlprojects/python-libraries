    "Here are **20 basic Python interview questions with one-line answers:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **1-5: Basic Concepts**  \n",
    "1. **What is Python?**  \n",
    "   â†’ Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What are the key features of Python?**  \n",
    "   â†’ Python is easy to learn, dynamically typed, interpreted, object-oriented, and supports libraries for AI/ML.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is the difference between Python and C/C++?**  \n",
    "   â†’ Python is dynamically typed and interpreted, while C/C++ are statically typed and compiled.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why is indentation important in Python?**  \n",
    "   â†’ Indentation defines code blocks in Python, replacing the need for curly braces `{}`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What does it mean that Python is a dynamically typed language?**  \n",
    "   â†’ Variable types are determined at runtime, so you donâ€™t need to declare them explicitly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **6-10: Data Types & Variables**  \n",
    "6. **What are the different data types in Python?**  \n",
    "   â†’ Common types include `int`, `float`, `str`, `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`, and `bool`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What are mutable and immutable data types? Give examples.**  \n",
    "   â†’ Mutable (changeable): `list`, `set`, `dict`; Immutable (unchangeable): `int`, `float`, `tuple`, `str`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "8. **What is the difference between `list`, `tuple`, and `set` in Python?**  \n",
    "   â†’ `list`: ordered, mutable; `tuple`: ordered, immutable; `set`: unordered, unique elements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "9. **How do you check the data type of a variable in Python?**  \n",
    "   â†’ Using `type(variable)`, e.g., `type(5) â†’ <class 'int'>`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "10. **What is type casting in Python? Give an example.**  \n",
    "   â†’ Converting one data type to another, e.g., `int(\"10\") â†’ 10`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **11-15: Control Flow & Loops**  \n",
    "11. **What are the different types of loops in Python?**  \n",
    "   â†’ `for` loop (for iteration) and `while` loop (until a condition is met).  \n",
    "\n",
    "12. **What is the difference between `break`, `continue`, and `pass` statements?**  \n",
    "   â†’ `break` exits loop, `continue` skips iteration, `pass` is a placeholder.  \n",
    "\n",
    "13. **What are conditional statements in Python?**  \n",
    "   â†’ `if`, `elif`, and `else` control flow based on conditions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "14. **How does a `for` loop work in Python?**  \n",
    "   â†’ It iterates over a sequence, e.g., `for i in range(5): print(i)`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "15. **What is the difference between `while` loop and `for` loop?**  \n",
    "   â†’ `while` loops run based on a condition, `for` loops iterate over sequences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **16-20: Functions & Miscellaneous**  \n",
    "16. **How do you define a function in Python?**  \n",
    "   â†’ Using `def`, e.g., `def greet(): print(\"Hello\")`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "17. **What is the difference between `return` and `print` in a function?**  \n",
    "   â†’ `return` gives a value back to the caller, `print` displays output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "18. **What is recursion in Python?**  \n",
    "   â†’ A function calling itself to solve problems, e.g., factorial calculation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "19. **What are *args and **kwargs in Python functions?**  \n",
    "   â†’ `*args` passes variable arguments as a tuple, `**kwargs` as a dictionary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "20. **What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy?**  \n",
    "   â†’ A shallow copy copies references (`copy.copy()`), while a deep copy clones objects (`copy.deepcopy()`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you need explanations! ðŸš€ðŸ˜Š"
